# Mattel-Button
This is a small project which looks at creating a set of buttons that hover. This will be expanded over time to transfer into any project without any problems.

1. Installation
Although this is very much an initial release stage which I do not expect to be used at all, you still have the ability to use this project.

    - Download the mattel.min.css file or copy the contents from it into your own CSS file.
    - in your HTML, add the class "mattel" to give the styling. This also provides the hover effect when the mouse is hovered over the     element
    
2. Development
The simplicity of this project is perhaps the reason I look forward to the development of this project. Button sets are a primary feature for HTML & CSS frameworks to supply and after dedicated support of this from myself, I see this as being a feature that could be used in conjunction with other small-time projects to an entire creation of a new framework.

    ---Please feel free to pull this and create simple changes that you feel necessary---
    
  NOTABLE FIXES REQUIRED FOR Ver_0.2:
  Wrapper for mattel to prevent the button from normal to hover state that occurs at bottom of the element near box-shadow.
  Different colorways and general stylings
  Overall high level of responsive design
  
  Thank you very much!
